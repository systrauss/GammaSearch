This code is based off the ICEBall-Coincidence-Code. However, instead of looking for 2 events in coincidence, it will look for three in coincidence instead. I am curious to see if this will help clean up the spectrum without background subtraction.

This will be a changelog until such time as the code is complete, and then it will be adjusted for instructions.
